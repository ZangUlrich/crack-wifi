Crack a wifi with Aircrack-ng and dictionary generator tools (like CUPP)

I provide in this repository a set of bash files to easily run a wifi crack.

- The `handshake_establish` file: Monitoring the network for handskake establishment.

- The `binary_gen_from_cat` file: Allows to generate the binary file from the .cat

- The `deauth` file: Allows to make a desauthentication to accelerate the process of obtaining the handshake.

- The `crack_of_password` file: Allows to crack the wifi password by brute force, from a dictionary.
